# Javascript LCF

Because I like to do the same things several times.

The goal of this repo is to replicate what have been done here:
- https://github.com/BruJu/JavaLCFReader
- https://github.com/BruJu/RMConvertisseurFields
- https://github.com/BruJu/RMDechiffreur

But:
- In Javascript, because
    - I currently prefer the JS ecosystem than the Java ecosystem
    - It's easier to type `npm install` and `node index.js` than ... do things
    in Java
- And in english

This project has a 99% chances to be abandoned.
